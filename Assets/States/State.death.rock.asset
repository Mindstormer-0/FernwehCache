  storyText: "Situation: You attempt to vault the obstacle swiftly by putting your
    right hand on the trunk and swinging your legs over the top to the left. Unfortunately,
    something is slick where you placed your hand, and you slip backwards, landing
    on your spine. Your head strikes a sharp rock. There\u2019s nothing you can do;
    you\u2019ve been almost immediately incapacitated! Darkness\u2026\r\n\nObservations:
    The last thing you remember before your head hit the rock in the scramble was
    that your right hand smelled like iron as it brushed past your face.\r\n\nOption
    A or B: Restart\n"
