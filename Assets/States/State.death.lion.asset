  storyText: "Situation: The gps device powers on. The screen is very bright and
    temporarily blinds you. Something brushes against your right hand, then - you
    feel a hot sudden pain on the right side of your neck. There\u2019s nothing you
    can do; you\u2019ve been almost immediately incapacitated! Darkness\u2026\r\n\nObservations:
    Was that a hissing noise? Your last thought was that the thing attacking you
    looked vaguely like a mountain lion.\r\n\nOption A or B: Restart."
