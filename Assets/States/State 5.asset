  storyText: "Situation: It\u2019s been a difficult walk through the forest. There
    are many ruts, rocks, and swampy obstacles. According to the gps, you\u2019ve
    made about 750 meters of progress from the southern edge of the forest. There
    appears to be a fork in the path now. One heads east and the other heads west.\r\n\nObservations:
    The path left (west) looks muddy and even swampier. The path right looks dry
    and has a torn piece of red cloth a few meters down the path \u2014 looks like
    someone caught their shirt on a broken branch. The summer air is hot and sticky,
    you are tired, and your feet feel like they\u2019re blistering.\r\n\nOption A:
    Go left (west).\r\nOption B: Go right (east).\r\n"
