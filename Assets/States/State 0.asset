  storyText: "Situation: Without any context, you suddenly realize you are sitting
    on a tree stump near the edge of an oddly beautiful, yet deep, and dark forest.
    In your left hand is a handheld global positioning device \u2014 the device is
    turned off.\r\n\nObservations: It appears to be night with a full moon, owls
    hoot in the distance. You hear the chorus of woodland insects humming in the
    summer heat. Your feet are sore, and you are noticeably hungry. You are wearing
    blue jeans, a red and black flannel, and hiking boots.\r\n\nThe way you see it,
    you now have two choices.\r\n\nOption A: Power on the handheld gps device.\r\nOption
    B: Amble into the forest, a narrow path is distinguishable ahead.\r"
