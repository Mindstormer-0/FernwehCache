  storyText: "Situation: The chest squeaks and is difficult to open but you manage
    to force it. Inside is three objects. The first is a scroll, bound with deer
    sinew in an intricate knot. The other two are \u2018AA\u2019 batteries.\n\nObservations:
    Everything is silent here except for a few crickets. The air is much cooler and
    smells sweet like new plant life. How could there be two \u2018AA\u2019 batteries
    in such an old chest? I guess I should swap out the nearly dead ones in my gps
    with these. You pop out the old ones, they fall on the ground and are lost in
    the darkness, \u201COops, oh well\u201D you say. You pop in the fresh batteries.\r\n\nOption
    A: Open the scroll.\r\nOption B: Test the gps with the new batteries.\r You want
    to get out of here later without getting lost.\n"
