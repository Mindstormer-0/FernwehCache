  storyText: "Situation: Moving carefully but urgently, you vault the rocks and continue
    on the path. You are too tired to run, but you\u2019re definitely alert now.
    The gps indicates the waypoint is just up ahead.\r\n\nObservations: After checking
    the gps waypoint, the device chirped and is indicating the batteries are about
    to die. You say to yourself, \u201Cwell, I might need more battery power later,
    I can find my way now, it\u2019s just up ahead.\u201D and turn off the gps. Whatever
    was behind you, it didn\u2019t follow you directly over the rocks.\r\n\nOption
    A: What am I doing? Turn that gps back on \u2013 you could miss the waypoint.\r\nOption
    B: Keep walking the trail, your eyes are adjusting to the darkness.\r\n"
