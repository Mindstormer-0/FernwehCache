  storyText: "Situation: Stepping into the clearing you immediately realize this
    is the southern edge of the dark forest. In fact, you appear to be very near
    where you started on the footpath. A little investigation shows the same footpath
    you took into the forest is just 50 meters east from where you exited. The gps
    is dead, you put it back into your pocket now \u2014 \u201CWhat\u2019s this?\u201D
    Two \u2018AA\u2019 batteries are in your left pocket. You pop out the old ones,
    they fall on the ground and are lost in the darkness, \u201COops, oh well\u201D
    you say. You pop in the fresh batteries.\r\n\nObservations: The gps is off but
    should have new batteries. You are tired, sore, & depressed. It is very dark,
    but now your eyesight has adjusted to the moonlight.\r\n\nOption A: Sit down
    for just a minute on a nice looking stump.\r\nOption B: Turn on the gps device
    again.\r\n"
