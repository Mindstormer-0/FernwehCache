  storyText: "Situation: You pop off the sinew and roll open the scroll, reading
    it the best you can in the deep heart of the forest.\r\n\nObservations: In the
    moonlight you can see the small scroll is a poem or riddle. The text is written
    in English, but is scribed in a spiral pattern from the outer edge in.\r\n\nThe
    scroll: \u201CThee who rests is never lost. The lost is never at rest. Find the
    truth here in this grove, and a treasure you lust for yet hath not seen will
    be given.\u201D\r\n\nOption A: Walk away frustrated, what does it mean? You have
    no choice but to leave the way you came.\r\nOption B: Sit down on a nearby tree
    stump. You are exhausted. Is there meaning here? It might be time to rest your
    eyes for a short while.\r\n"
