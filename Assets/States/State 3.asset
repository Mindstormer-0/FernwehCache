  storyText: 'Situation: Stepping into the dark forest, you choose to follow the
    footpath as best you can. It appears to be heading in the same direction as the
    waypoint is set to.


    Observations: You have no light other than the glowing
    gps, which is not good for your darkness adjusting eyesight. It could spell disaster
    for you as you go deeper. *SNAP* Was that another stick cracking behind you?


    Option
    A: Keep following the footpath.

    Option B: Turn around, what was that noise!?
