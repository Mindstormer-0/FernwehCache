  storyText: "Situation: A short way up you come across a clearing. This must be
    the spot the gps was taking you to\u2026 but why? \r\n\nObservations: In the
    center of the clearing is a chest made of wood. In the moonlight you can see
    the chest is about a meter wide and is intricately carved and inlayed with what
    looks like granite.\r\n\nOption A: Approach and open the chest.\r\nOption B:
    Turn around and flee the way you came. This is far too intense.\r\n"
