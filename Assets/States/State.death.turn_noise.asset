  storyText: "Situation: You swiftly turn around clockwise. As you are moving, you
    hear a hiss sound to your right. Your eyes dart in that direction \u2013 what
    made that sound? Before you can acquire any understanding of what you\u2019re
    looking at, you feel the air knocked out of your lungs and your chest feels like
    it\u2019s been crushed. A hot sudden pain sears your throat and trachea. There\u2019s
    nothing you can do; you\u2019ve been almost immediately incapacitated! Darkness\u2026\r\n\nObservations:
    Your last thought was that the hiss noise was very cat like. Like an agitated
    mountain lion?\r\n\nOption A or B: Restart\n"
