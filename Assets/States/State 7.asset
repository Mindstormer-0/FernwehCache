  storyText: "Situation: Choosing the eastern path was a good choice. After another
    350 meters it bends back to the north, and you think you\u2019re headed right
    to the waypoint. There is a noticeable incline upwards now, you\u2019ll need
    to vault over some rocks ahead of you to continue.\r\n\nObservations: How could
    it be that your feet hurt so much? One kilometer shouldn\u2019t be so rough on
    your body, could it? The sound of insects droning away is intense and you feel
    like you are approaching the heart of the forest. At least there aren\u2019t
    too many mosquitos. *SNAP* Another branch snaps behind you, the hairs on your
    nape stand on end and you get goosebumps, you\u2019re being stalked.\r\n\nOption
    A: Move carefully, taking your time in the darkness as to not injure yourself.\r\nOption
    B: Move swiftly, vault the rocks as fast as you can \u2013 there\u2019s definitely
    something behind you.\r\n"
