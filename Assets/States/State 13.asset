  storyText: 'Situation: By falling asleep in the fernweh grove, you suddenly awoke
    in a familiar place. Everything feels sharp and real, it''s morning instead of
    night.


    Hypothesis: Perhaps you were visited whilst sleeping by an ancient
    spirit of the forest. Or perhaps it was all just a crazy dream.


    Observation:
    You are sweating, tired, hungry, and you have blisters on your feet. In your
    left pocket are two fresh ''AA'' batteries. Hmmm, those definitely weren''t there
    before you drifted off.



    The way you see it, you now have two choices.
