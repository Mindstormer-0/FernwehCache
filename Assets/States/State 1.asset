  storyText: "Situation: The device comes to life after you hold the power button
    for a few seconds. The display is very bright and temporarily blinds you. After
    a minute, you can see the device indicates there is a set of coordinates already
    entered as a waypoint.\r\n\nObservations: According to the display on the gps,
    you are only 1.2 kilometers south of the waypoint. You thought you heard a dry
    stick snap somewhere ahead of you - local wildlife?\r\n\nOption A: Head into
    the forest, you can just make out a small path ahead (north), but it is getting
    very dark.\r\nOption B: It\u2019s too dark. Turn around (south) and run away,
    hoping you remember why you are here and how to get back to your home, if you
    have one.\r\n"
